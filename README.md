# A Real-time Clustering Scheme using Coordinate Density for 3D Localization

## Abstract

The demand for indoor localization technology in the field of automation is growing at a very high rate. Typical examples include logistics automation and construction safety management. In general, the most used technique in the real-time localization field is trilateration. However, when the trilateration method is used, the performance of the sensing data is greatly affected by the radio frequency environment of the surrounding environment, so errors occur a lot in the measured data. If these errors can be eliminated, the performance of localization will be improved. In this paper, we propose a real-time clustering scheme using coordinate density for 3D localization in order to improve this problem.
